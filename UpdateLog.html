		<p>This is where I (Gryphon) will post new changes I make to the sheets, along with the date they were published.
		This logging began April 3rd, 2023, and any changes before that were not logged. These past updates may eventually
		be logged if I can find dates and specifics, in which case I will note that in this introduction.</p>

			<h4>April 3rd 2023</h4>
			<p> - Added locked checkboxes for labels on character sheets. 
			These boxes do not prevent the labels from being changed, 
			but are instead a visual indicator for convenience.</p>
			<p> - Added Update Log</p>
			<p> - Change Playbooks header on main page to same as rest of the headers for consistency</p>
